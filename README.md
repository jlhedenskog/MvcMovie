# MvcMovie Tutorial
MvcMovie is a tutorial I went through that gave me an in-depth look at how to create a ASP.NET Core MVC web application using controllers, views, models, and databases.



# What I learned

### While going through this tutorial, I learned how to do several things including:

- Creating a web application
- Adding and scaffolding a model
- Creating and working with a database - including database seeding
- Adding search and validation functionality 

## Understanding the Parts of a URL



|                |https[]()://something.com/Home/TacoCat                       
|----------------|-------------------------------
|Home            |Controller            
|TacoCat         |Action Name           

A URL with no **Action Name** will automatically default to *Index*. 


## Terms, Terms, Terms

 - **Controller**

Think about a controller as being like someone who would service your requests. A controller is responsible for handling any incoming URL/browser request. 

- **View**

A view is basically equivalent to a webpage. It contains all the HTML and content that is sent to the browser when an action is called.

- **Model**

Models are classes that represent the data of an application. For example, a Cat model will gather data about cats from a database, provide it to the view or update it.
